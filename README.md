# Object-Show-Character-Ranking-Visualization

Source code and files for visualizing rankings of characters in object shows for their performance in object show challenges, using a Elo-like rating system.

All .java programs, together with all the files in folder BFDI/, can be run as-is and should give the same output as what is shown in the videos below.

**NOTE:** The code for BFDI 1 rankings has a major bug in its rating calculations that completely messes up characters' rankings. This bug has been kept in the original code for archiving purposes.
