# Object-Show-Character-Ranking-Visualization

Source code and files for visualizing rankings of characters in object shows for their performance in object show challenges, using a Elo-like rating system.

All .java programs, together with all the files in folder BFDI/, can be run as-is and should give the same output as what is shown in the videos below.

**NOTE:** The code for BFDI 1 rankings has a major bug in its rating calculations that completely messes up characters' rankings. This bug has been kept in the original code for archiving purposes.

Files used in each of my videos:

BFDI 1 rankings (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7Z_IUhKCk4): ```src/Ranker.java, BFDI/s1.txt, BFDI/colors.txt```

BFB rankings (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f4ItkxcFB8): ```src/Ranker2.java, BFDI/bfb.txt, BFDI/bfb_colors.txt, BFDI/voting_icons```
